    **Data Download API**

    **Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.
    <br>

    This API allows the caller to download a previously uploaded data content.<br>    
    You can use this API in a scenario like downloading an existing collection of geofences uploaded previously using the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview) for use in our [Azure Maps Geofencing Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial). 
    
    
    ### Submit Download Request

    To download your content you will use a `GET` request where the path will contain the `udid` of the data to download. Optionally, you can also pass in an `Accept` header to specify a preference for the `Content-Type` of the data response. <br>
    For example, to download a collection of geofences previously uploaded using the Upload API, set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received previously in the upload API response and set the `Accept` header to either one of the following media types: 
        
      - `application/json`
      - `application/vnd.geo+json`
      - `application/octet-stream`


    ### Download Data Response

    The Download API will return a HTTP `200 OK` response if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is found, where the response body will contain the content of the data resource.<br>
    A HTTP `400 Bad Request` error response will be returned if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is not found.<br>

    Here's a sample response body for a simple geofence represented in `GeoJSON` uploaded previously using the Upload API:
    <br>

    ```json
    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [{
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-122.126986, 47.639754]
            },
            "properties": {
                "geometryId": "001",
                "radius": 500
            }
        }]
    }
    ```
